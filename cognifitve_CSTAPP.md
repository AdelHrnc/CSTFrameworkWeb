AI can offer custom prompts at different stages of creativity. |
|  |  | "Paper 25. Provide prompts to help children recall details from their body enactment, which involves physically acting out story ideas, when writing their stories (e.g., static prompting: prompts at specific stages in the writing process; dynamic prompting: prompts adapted to the children's state or actions).

[""During the writing, without the physical presence of the character (the child’s own body) and the prop, these details were not expressed in many cases. That may be due to the cognitive demand of writing, which causes a limit to the number of details the child remembers or can express. 

In classroom settings, teachers use structured prompts and feedback in the form of regular conferencing to guide the students on what details to add to their story and how to complete the narrative structure [21, 44]. Therefore, an important design consideration for the enactment-based authoring system would be to provide prompts for these aspects of the story.""] |
|  |  | "Look at what they say about writing proficiency and cognition:
A design consideration for enactment-based story writing support systems can be adaptability to the level of the child's writing proficiency by providing more guiding prompts when needed but fewer prompts for children with higher proficiency levels. The child's proficiency level can be assigned based on a number of factors, including age and their performance in a baseline task.

Provide a pre-defined structure to help children construct the basic components of a story (e.g., choose main characters, define traits, and set the narrative framework) while allowing flexibility for emergent storytelling, enabling them to iteratively expand, adapt, and refine the narratives as they progress.

[""Second, it is crucial to balance “overall planning” and “emergent storytelling” for high-quality creative story creation. A good story usually contains a mature and potentially complex narrative structure that is planned in advance by the storyteller [26]. Therefore, it is beneficial to guide children in planning the global story structure first and then enable them to leverage the advancements of AI to fill the story gaps with serendipitous details, while maintaining their creative ownership during the child-AI collaboration [4].

The system should allow children to plan the story structure while also opening possibilities for emergent storytelling, serendipitous discovery, and iterative creation""] |

This paper focused on overall idea formation of one’s creation as an important aspect in creative activity, but does not cover the entirety of creative activity. In the area of creative activity the importance of metacognitive activity has been pointed out, where one reflects upon one’s own actions (e.g. Dewey [6] and Schön [28]). Systems which support such reflective thinking activity are also being explored in the HCI field (e.g. [19]). We see great potential in future work on including adding reflective thinking elements in creative interfaces such as Vuzik.""] |

|  |  | "Paper 32. Use subtle visual cues (e.g., gradual fading or translucency UI) and playful feedback (e.g., animations or entertaining evaluations) to gently encourage children to engage with playback features for self-reflection, while avoiding intrusive or overly directive prompts.

[""For M1 (Playback), it may be beneficial to increase children’s awareness of how often they press play. A subtle approach could be to detect when a child has performed a low number of playback interactions and use this as a trigger for gradually making the play button more translucent, based on similar HCI studies that have used fading techniques to draw attention to UI features [3, 4]. 

Alternatively, we could perhaps start playback automatically to prompt children — although this could be too obtrusive and detrimental to engagement. We could also take inspiration from Casual Creators [19] and provide entertaining evaluations to provide motivation as children self-assess their work (cf. T4 and T5). For example, a fun animation could reward children for using playback.""] |

[ In terms of effective creative apps in middle childhood, the MDH would thus expect that apps which differ only moderately from what the user’s developmental capabilities will be more enjoyable and ultimately more effective. This proposition is line with propositions of flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997) which suggests that digital content will be most enjoyable and engaging when users achieve a state of flow (Sherry, 2004). This  flow state occurs when cognitive skills of the person and the task of the game are in balance. ] |
